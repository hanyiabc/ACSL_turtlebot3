This is a quick bring up guide for the turtle bot 3 waffle pi model, and the remote PC. It will closely follow the official Robotis E-Manual
\url{https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/} 
with notable  divergences covered in detail.



To begin you will need to install the appropriate ROS version on your remote PC. The remote PC will be running ROS Melodic which is backwards compatible with ROS Kinetic (The Distribution running on the Turtlebot's onboard computer).

The following page from the ROBOTIS Emanual describes the process for adding and installing all neccesary packages to your ROS Environment.
